# Shooter
Shooter is a simple 2D game, written in Java with JavaFX

The goal of the game is to destroy enemy turrets using your tank    
Enemies have shields that periodically appear and disappear  
On the title screen the player can select between a variety of tanks, levels and difficulties that alter enemies health, player health and player speed  
Pickups can randomly appear to recover health, replenish special ammo, or give the player a shield that reflects enemy bullets
